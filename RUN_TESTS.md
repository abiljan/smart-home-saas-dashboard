## Observed Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Console Errors (Fixed)
- **Issue**: "User rejected the request" errors (code 4001)
- **Root Cause**: Missing CORS headers and error handling
- **Solution**: Added proper CORS middleware and improved error handling

### Browser Notifications
- **Issue**: Notification permission denied by default
- **Status**: Expected behavior - users must manually allow notifications
- **Impact**: Notifications work once user grants permission

### Database Connection
- **Issue**: Supabase connection failing in development
- **Solution**: Implemented hybrid storage with in-memory fallback
- **Status**: Dashboard fully functional with test data
