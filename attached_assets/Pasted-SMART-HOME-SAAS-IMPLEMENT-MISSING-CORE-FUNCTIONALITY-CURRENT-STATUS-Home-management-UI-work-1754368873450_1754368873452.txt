SMART HOME SAAS - IMPLEMENT MISSING CORE FUNCTIONALITY

CURRENT STATUS:
- Home management UI working ✅
- Device discovery interface complete ✅
- Need to implement emergency system and settings ✅

IMPLEMENT THESE CRITICAL FEATURES:

1. **Emergency Panel** (/homes/:homeId/emergency):
   - Large red "EMERGENCY" button (always visible)
   - Emergency contact form (sends to Primary Admin)
   - One-tap contact with location context
   - Auto-escalation if no response in 5 minutes
   - Works offline with cached contact info

2. **Settings Page** (/homes/:homeId/settings):
   - Home information (name, address)
   - Member management (invite/remove users)
   - Emergency contacts setup
   - Notification preferences
   - Home sharing settings

3. **Guest View** (/homes/:homeId/guest):
   - Simplified device browser
   - "Ask a Question" chat interface
   - Emergency button (prominent)
   - Clean design for non-tech users

4. **Device Documentation System**:
   - Click device → show manual/instructions
   - "Find Manual" automation (API integration)
   - Custom notes section
   - Usage instructions

5. **AI Question System** (Core MVP Feature):
   - Natural language Q&A about devices
   - Context-aware responses (device + location)
   - "How do I turn on the Living Room TV?"
   - Rate responses for learning
