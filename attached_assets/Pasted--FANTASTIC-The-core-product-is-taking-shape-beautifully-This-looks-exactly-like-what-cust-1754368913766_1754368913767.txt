**üéâ FANTASTIC! The core product is taking shape beautifully!**

This looks exactly like what customers need - clean, intuitive interface for managing their smart home documentation. I can see you have:

‚úÖ **Home Management** - Multiple homes with stats  
‚úÖ **Device Discovery** - WiFi scan and manual entry  
‚úÖ **Device Organization** - By room with proper details  
‚úÖ **Professional UI** - Clean, modern design  

## üîß **Missing Functionality - Let's Add It**

You mentioned the **Emergency Panel** and **Settings** buttons aren't working. Let's implement the core functionality:

SMART HOME SAAS - IMPLEMENT MISSING CORE FUNCTIONALITY

CURRENT STATUS:
- Home management UI working ‚úÖ
- Device discovery interface complete ‚úÖ
- Need to implement emergency system and settings ‚úÖ

IMPLEMENT THESE CRITICAL FEATURES:

1. **Emergency Panel** (/homes/:homeId/emergency):
   - Large red "EMERGENCY" button (always visible)
   - Emergency contact form (sends to Primary Admin)
   - One-tap contact with location context
   - Auto-escalation if no response in 5 minutes
   - Works offline with cached contact info

2. **Settings Page** (/homes/:homeId/settings):
   - Home information (name, address)
   - Member management (invite/remove users)
   - Emergency contacts setup
   - Notification preferences
   - Home sharing settings

3. **Guest View** (/homes/:homeId/guest):
   - Simplified device browser
   - "Ask a Question" chat interface
   - Emergency button (prominent)
   - Clean design for non-tech users

4. **Device Documentation System**:
   - Click device ‚Üí show manual/instructions
   - "Find Manual" automation (API integration)
   - Custom notes section
   - Usage instructions

5. **AI Question System** (Core MVP Feature):
   - Natural language Q&A about devices
   - Context-aware responses (device + location)
   - "How do I turn on the Living Room TV?"
   - Rate responses for learning

BACKEND API ENDPOINTS TO ADD:

```typescript
// Emergency system
POST /api/homes/:homeId/emergency - Send emergency alert
GET /api/homes/:homeId/emergency-contacts - Get contact info

// Settings
GET /api/homes/:homeId/settings - Get home settings
PUT /api/homes/:homeId/settings - Update home settings
POST /api/homes/:homeId/invite - Invite user to home
DELETE /api/homes/:homeId/members/:userId - Remove member

// Device documentation
GET /api/devices/:deviceId/manual - Get device manual
POST /api/devices/:deviceId/find-manual - Auto-find manual
PUT /api/devices/:deviceId/notes - Update custom notes

// AI Q&A system
POST /api/homes/:homeId/ask - Ask question about devices
GET /api/homes/:homeId/chat-history - Get previous Q&A
```

EMERGENCY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION:
```typescript
// Emergency workflow
POST /api/homes/:homeId/emergency
{
  "message": "Guest needs help with...",
  "location": "Living Room", 
  "urgency": "high",
  "guestContact": "optional"
}

Response triggers:
1. Immediate SMS/email to Primary Admin
2. Push notification if available
3. 5-minute timer starts
4. If no response ‚Üí notify Secondary Admin
5. Log all emergency events
```

AI CHAT SYSTEM (Core Feature):
```typescript
// Simple Q&A implementation
POST /api/homes/:homeId/ask
{
  "question": "How do I turn on the Living Room TV?",
  "context": {
    "room": "Living Room",
    "devices": ["Samsung TV", "Universal Remote"]
  }
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "To turn on your Samsung TV: 1. Find the Samsung remote...",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "sources": ["Samsung QN65Q70T Manual", "User Notes"],
  "followUpSuggestions": ["How to change channels", "How to adjust volume"]
}
```

FOCUS PRIORITIES:
1. Emergency button functionality (critical for MVP)
2. Basic AI Q&A system (core value proposition)
3. Device manual integration
4. Guest interface optimization
5. Settings and member management

This implements the core value proposition: smart home documentation that helps guests use unfamiliar devices safely.
```
