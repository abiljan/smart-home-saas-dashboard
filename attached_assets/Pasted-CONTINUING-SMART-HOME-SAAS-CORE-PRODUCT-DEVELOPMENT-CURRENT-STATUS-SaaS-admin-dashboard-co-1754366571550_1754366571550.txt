CONTINUING SMART HOME SAAS - CORE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

CURRENT STATUS: 
- SaaS admin dashboard complete ✅
- Database and auth infrastructure ready ✅
- Need to build the actual customer-facing smart home documentation system

TASK: Implement Phase 2 from PRD - Device Discovery & Documentation System

CREATE NEW CUSTOMER-FACING ROUTES:
1. /homes - Home management for Primary/Secondary Admins
2. /homes/:homeId/devices - Device discovery and management
3. /homes/:homeId/guest - Guest interface for asking questions
4. /homes/:homeId/emergency - Emergency panic button

CORE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **Home Management Page** (/homes):
   - Create new home
   - List existing homes for user
   - Invite secondary admins/guests
   - Home settings

2. **Device Discovery System** (/homes/:homeId/devices):
   - WiFi network scanning interface
   - Manual device entry form
   - Barcode scanning (web camera API)
   - Device list with status

3. **Documentation System**:
   - Automatic manual fetching (ManualsOnline API)
   - Document storage and caching
   - Manual override/custom notes

4. **Guest Interface** (/homes/:homeId/guest):
   - Simple device browser
   - "Ask a question" chat interface
   - Emergency panic button (prominent)

5. **Database Extensions**:
   - homes table (name, address, primary_admin_id)
   - devices table (home_id, name, model, discovery_method)
   - documentation table (device_id, manual_content, source)
   - user_homes table (user_id, home_id, role)

ONBOARDING FLOW (Critical for MVP):
1. User signs up → Auto-create first home
2. "Let's discover your first device" → WiFi scan OR manual entry
3. System finds manual automatically
4. "Ask a question about this device" → Test AI response
5. "Great! Invite your first guest/family member"

USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Current database (extend with new tables)
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- shadcn/ui components
- WebSocket for real-time device discovery

FOCUS: Simple, working device discovery and Q&A system. This is what customers pay for!
