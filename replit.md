# Smart Home SaaS Dashboard

## Overview

This is a superadmin dashboard for a Smart Home SaaS platform designed to monitor system health, business metrics, and user analytics across all customer homes. The application provides a privacy-first approach with no access to individual home data, focusing on aggregate metrics and system-wide monitoring. Built as a full-stack TypeScript application with React frontend and Express backend, it features real-time updates, browser notifications for critical alerts, and emergency control capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket client for live dashboard updates
- **Notifications**: Browser Notification API for critical alerts

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket support for real-time features
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket server for broadcasting dashboard changes
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

### Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL configured through Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Design**: Structured tables for system metrics, health monitoring, critical alerts, activity logs, emergency settings, and user management
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL integration

### Authentication and Authorization
- **User System**: Simple username/password authentication with role-based access
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store using connect-pg-simple
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions with superadmin default role

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL serverless)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundation
- **Real-time**: Native WebSocket implementation
- **Notifications**: Browser Notification API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Development**: Replit-specific plugins for development environment integration

Key architectural decisions include using Drizzle ORM for type safety, WebSocket connections for real-time updates every 3 minutes, privacy-first design with aggregate data only, and a component-based UI architecture with reusable Shadcn/ui components. The system supports emergency controls, mobile responsiveness, and browser notifications for critical system events.
